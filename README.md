A project for the course CS-A2120 Programming Studio 2: Project at Aalto University. 
Reference on request.

This app will fit linear regression and quadratic regression models to a dataset
and visualize those models along with the data points. Some simple dianogstics such as
coefficient of determination are also included. The app can fit the models to datasets with
hundreds of millions of data points in only a few minutes.

Usage: Clone the repository and open the project in Intellij IDEA with the Scala plug-in installed. The program is started by right-clicking on `RegressionApp` located in `src/main/scala/regressionGui/RegressionApp` and choose `Run "RegressionApp"`. The program was built with Scala sbt.
